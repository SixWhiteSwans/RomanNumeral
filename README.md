# RomanNumeral
Converts Roman numeral to Arabic numbers and back

The design is to ensure the functions pure functions, and no side effects are created. The to Value files are to valid the source data to allow for seperation and better testing. In addition the inful values are immutable and the functions are thread safe.

further design improvements would be to injects the anonymous functions into a converter, would would seperate the behaviour further.
